#Dotfiles

Simply a place to dump my dotfiles.

##Installation

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/HorseMD/dotfiles.git` to download these dotfiles.
2. Files `/xmonad/xmonad.hs`, `init.el`, `bashrc` and `vimrc` all need to be linked to their respective locations.

##Todo

* Write a bash script to install the dotfiles (namely symbolic linking)
