#Dotfiles

Simply a place to dump my dotfiles.

##Installation

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/HorseMD/dotfiles.git` to download these dotfiles.
2. Mark `install.sh` as executable (`chmod +x install.sh`).
3. Run `install.sh`.

A backup of any existing dotfiles will be placed in the `dotfiles_bkp` folder which will be
created in the same directory by `install.sh`, should it need to.

##TODO

1. Separate `xmobarrc` file for laptops (or rather, devices with batteries).
